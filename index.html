            <p>Will code for catnip? These are theatrics and are powerful agents to the uninitiated. Unfortunate for you, I am initiated. Shhh. Oh yes, I was wondering what would break first, your spirit or your body? Certainly not my code. Shhh. Holds power button. Screen goes dark. You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a cat, by then to me it was only blinding. Shhh. The shadows betray you because they belong to me. Shhh. Breaks backspace key. Shhh. The Veterinarian tried removing my mask. Shhh. It was extremely painful... for him. Shhh. Calm down doctor, now is not the time for fear. That comes later.  Shhh. Speak of the devil and he shall appear... to be coughing up a furball. Shhh... </p>
